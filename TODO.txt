Handle "cause" exceptions! Need a recursive jsonToException method.

Move register() method into client code, after making more things settable.
	Static set methods? Better: a CustomizeReport callback.

Do something with that nice shiny Authorization header.

Server: Handle any strange failures.
	If exception class throws ClassNotFound, synthesize it w/ asm/javassist?

More and better unit tests.

Move Register method into client code, after making more things settable.
	Static set methods? Better: a CustomizeReport callback.

Handle "cause" exceptions! Need a recursive jsonToException method.

Server: Handle any strange failures.
	If exception class not found, maybe synthesize it w/ asm/javassist?

More and better unit tests.

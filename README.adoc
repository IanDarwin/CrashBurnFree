= CrashBurnFree

CrashBurnFree is a free crash reporting tool for Java (and potentially other languages).
The name is a pun, as (a) it's _free_ to use and modify  and (b) one over-arching goal of Software Checking Tools 
is to _free_ you from crashing and burning...

It is composed of the following sub-projects:

. javalibrary - a bit o' common code;
. javaclient - the Java client code; no external dependencies;
. javaserver - an implementation of a Java EE (REST JAXRS) server

Status: javaclient seems to work, but javaserver is not yet "declared operational".

<h1>CrashBurnFree</h1>
<p>
<a href='https://github.com/IanDarwin/CrashBurnFree'>CrashBurnFree</a> is 
an open-source project for error reporting
from deployed applications back to the deployer's website.
If you are seeing this page, the people who run an application
you use have probably deployed CrashBurnFree, but there is not
a web-based interface to the received crash reports yet;
the demo can only be accessed via the REST API that is installed 
as part of the client library.

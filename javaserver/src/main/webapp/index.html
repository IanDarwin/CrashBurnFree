<h1>CrashBurnFree</h1>
<p>
<a href='https://github.com/IanDarwin/CrashBurnFree'>CrashBurnFree</a> is 
an open-source project for error reporting
from deployed applications back to the deployer's website.
If you are seeing this page, the people who run an application
you use have probably deployed CrashBurnFree, but you are not
accessing it correctly; it is only meant to be accessed
via the REST API that is installed as part of the client library.
